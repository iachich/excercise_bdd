**Exercise: Python-Based Embedded BDD Testing with Pytest**
To run the sample: docker-compose up --build

**Scenario:**
You are working on an embedded system that controls a temperature control unit for a coffee maker. Your task is to implement BDD tests for a basic feature of this system: heating up the water when the user selects a coffee brewing option.

**Requirements:**

1. The temperature control unit should have three states: OFF, HEATING, and READY.
2. By default, it should be in the OFF state.
3. When the user selects a coffee brewing option, it should transition from OFF to HEATING and then to READY when the desired temperature is reached.

**Instructions:**

1. Set up a new Python project for this exercise. You can use Pytest for writing BDD-style tests. We have provided you with a dummy framework implementation.

2. Create a Python module for the temperature control unit with functions to control its state (e.g., `set_temperature_state(state)`). We have provided you with a dummy product implementation. Make sure you understand the project and familiarize yourself with basic python package creation, docker, pytest and bdd.

3. Write a state diagram for the coffee maker and describe the boundary conditions for the transitions.

4. Have a look at the `TemperatureControlUnit` class in your Python module. Notice how it's just a sample implementation and isn't doing anything. Get creative and provide some options for a developer to implement an actual coffee maker as well as how you would test this. No code stubs needed for this part of the excercise

5. Write a runner script or use Pytest's built-in test runner to execute the tests. Ensure that the tests pass successfully for the specified scenarios. The test cases should cover different aspects of the behavior, including the initial state, user input events, and expected state transitions. A rough harness has been provided in tests/test_temperature_control.py

6. Now that we wrote some tests - great! Verify they pass
